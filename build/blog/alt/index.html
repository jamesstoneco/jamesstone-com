  <p>Thats a lot of S&rsquo;s. Try and say that five times fast. I was pretty excited about the <a href="http://zurb.com/article/1274/we-feel-the-need-the-need-for-speed-what-">Zurb announcement of Zurb Foundation 5</a> due for release this next week. One thing that caught my eye was this line:</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, for the nerd in all of you, we&rsquo;ve built a new command line tool that will let you spin up Foundation projects preposterously fast, and those projects will now use <span class="inline-code">Libsass</span>, a back-end Sass compiling library that will dramatically speed up how long it takes for your SCSS changes to take effect while you work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I was curious and wanted to find out what <a href="https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass">libsass</a> was all about. I can tell you, they are being very modest about the speed difference.</p>

<p>I ran two tests on a fairly basic compass sass install of Zurb Foundation 4.3. The speed difference was staggering.</p>

<pre><code>  $ time sassc -o output.css -I /Users/james/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p448/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/zurb-foundation-4.3.2/scss sass/app.scss

  real  0m0.187s
  user  0m0.168s
  sys 0m0.016s
  [20131116_001450] james@MNWA:~/temp/zurbfun
  $ time compass compile
  overwrite stylesheets/app.css

  real  0m6.151s
  user  0m5.210s
  sys 0m0.215s
  [20131116_001504] james@MNWA:~/temp/zurbfun
</code></pre>

<p>Yes you are reading that correctly. That is 6.151 seconds for compass compared to 0.187 seconds for sassc. That is over 32 times faster!</p>

<p>Now, if I can just get it working with grunt watch like <a href="http://benfrain.com/lightning-fast-sass-compiling-with-libsass-node-sass-and-grunt-sass">this guy</a>, I will be all set.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/zurb-foundation-5-medium-grid/">Zurb Foundation 5 Medium Grid</a> <span>Nov 13</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>One of the <a href="http://zurb.com/article/1226/foundation-4-3-paving-the-road-to-5">hidden features included with Foundation 4.3</a> is the Tablet or Medium grid. This isn&rsquo;t enabled by default but it is super easy to implement. I just recently added it on this site. Lets take a look at how I went about it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you are using the sass version of foundation it is super easy to implement. Just uncomment the line:</p>

<p><code><pre class="scss">// Use this grid if you want to start using the new Foundation 5 grid early.
// It will change breakpoints to min-width: 640px and 1024px.
//
@import &quot;foundation/components/grid-5&quot;;
</pre></code></p>

<p>Thats pretty much it. After running compass compile or watch or automatically if you are using something that supports the Sprocket Asset Pipeline such as Rails or Middleman. Well not exactly, what seems like a simple change has some pretty drastic changes on an already existing site.</p>

<p>All of your medium grid elements will act as mobile, unless you add them specifically. Sometimes this is what you want, but often it is not. A tablet has quite a bit of screen real estate so you don&rsquo;t want to start stacking everything necessarily.</p>

<p>So what do you do? Just mimic your large classes. So if you have a <span class="inline-code">.large-6</span> add a <span class="inline-code">.medium-6</span> to match it. If you have a <span class="inline-code">.large-10.large-uncentered</span> add a <span class="inline-code">.medium-10.medium-uncentered</span> to match it. The same goes for <span class="inline-code">.large-centered</span> and just about everything else.</p>

<p>In my case I wanted to mimic the large grid for nearly everything. The navigation, the blog listings and so on. There was one area where I made a minor tweak where I believe it is improving the user experience.</p>

<p><code> <pre class="html">&lt;% wrap<em>layout :layout do %&gt;
...
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;large-8 large-centered columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;% test</em>featured<em>image = current</em>page.data.featured<em>image %&gt;
      &lt;% if ( defined?(test</em>featured<em>image)) %&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;small-12 medium-8 medium-centered large-12 columns&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= current</em>page.data.featured_image %&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;% end %&gt;
      &lt;%= yield %&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
...
&lt;% end %&gt;
</pre> </code></p>

<p>I spend a ton of time reading blogs both on my computer and on my iPad. Often most blogs do one of two things. They either stretch the content out from edge to edge or they add white space to the sides to add to the readability. Well, on desktop browsers that is. I can&rsquo;t tell you how frustrating it is when a blog does this on my iPad and disables the zoom. This means I get this really compressed column of text that just makes it irritating to read. Sure you can use a tool such as readability to improve this, but I think that blogs should provide a great experience by default on the browser.</p>

<ul class="clearing-thumbs" data-clearing>
  <li><a href="../../images/blog/2013/medium-grid/ipad-landscape-before-6ec93959.png"><img data-caption="iPad Landscape Before" src="../../images/blog/2013/medium-grid/ipad-landscape-before-6ec93959.png" class="th" width="200"></a></li>
  <li><a href="../../images/blog/2013/medium-grid/ipad-landscape-after-b19ccfc6.png"><img data-caption="iPad Landscape After" src="../../images/blog/2013/medium-grid/ipad-landscape-after-b19ccfc6.png" class="th" width="200"></a></li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<p>So, this was a case where I left the medium grid off. This means on a desktop browser with the large grid you you get a reasonable amount of white space which improves readability, but I get edge to edge on my iPad, which also improves readability. The problem is that I calculated images sizes for retina iPhones, 320px wide doubled to 640px. On the iPad now, 640px isn&rsquo;t enough to fill the screen. In addition, I think it would take up too much screen real estate even if I took this approach.</p>

<p>So what I came up with was to wrap my image with a <span class="inline-code">.small-12.medium-8.medium-centered.large-12.columns</span> which acts to compress the image width on the medium grid.</p>

<ul class="clearing-thumbs" data-clearing>
  <li><a href="../../images/blog/2013/medium-grid/ipad-portrait-before-7f3e7780.png"><img data-caption="iPad Potrait Before" src="../../images/blog/2013/medium-grid/ipad-portrait-before-7f3e7780.png" class="th" width="200"></a></li>
  <li><a href="../../images/blog/2013/medium-grid/ipad-portrait-after-7c64f256.png"><img data-caption="iPad Potrait After" src="../../images/blog/2013/medium-grid/ipad-portrait-after-7c64f256.png" class="th" width="200"></a></li>
</ul>

  <h2><a href="/blog/using-zurb-ink-with-mailchimp/">Using Zurb Ink with MailChimp</a> <span>Nov 13</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>Zurb Ink is for email as Zurb Foundation is for the web. <a href="http://zurb.com/article/1119/create-emails-for-any-device-introducing-">Zurb teased us late last year</a> with their responsive email templates but they have now taken it one huge step further. They have created a easy to use responsive framework that is available with the same permissive MIT license. I wanted to see how difficult it would be to use this new framework with MailChimp, my newsletter and email provider. Turns out, it was super simple. Lets take a look at how I went about it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Email and mobile email is becoming so important today. Not only is a lot of traffic going mobile but email is increasing an important tool for connecting with your audience and increasing engagement with your apps. Giving your customers a great mobile experience through email seems to be the next level of responsive design and modern website marketing and engagement.</p>

<p>I read through all the documentation and there is one big issue with Zurb Ink. Ironically, it isn&rsquo;t Microsoft technology (I&rsquo;m looking at you IE) but rather from Google. The issue is with the Gmail app on android displaying the desktop style grid. However, the Gmail app for iOS works great. Go figure. Hopefully Google will catch on soon. Another note is this is just the Android Gmail app. If you use the built in android mail client it displays fine. Boo Google and awesome job MS, I commend you.</p>

<p>I wanted to send out a simple newsletter and I took some time to see what types of elements caused the largest distortion in that particular email client. I noticed that the large social media buttons at the bottom of most of the templates that Zurb provides seemed to be the most glaring. Maybe because of the bold colors.</p>

<p>I started with the <a href="http://zurb.com/ink/templates.php">Newsletter Template</a> (included in the all templates download) and edited and removed what I didn&rsquo;t need. Here is what I ended up with:</p>

<p>The first time I opened one of these templates I was thinking, wow. This some sort of nested table bad dream. I thought we had moved past tables and started using divs for most of everything. Well, I guess when it comes to email, even mobile email we are still circa 1996. If you are interested in the real reason for the table use I suggest you check out <a href="http://zurb.com/article/1119/create-emails-for-any-device-introducing-">Zurb&rsquo;s original post</a>.</p>

<p>What is an improvement here though is the use of clearly labeled presentational class names. They look familiar because they use the old Zurb Foundation 3 naming convention: twelve columns, etc. What is nice here is you can just inline the css that comes with the framework in a style tag and that will get you set for the next step. Getting this all to work with MailChimp.</p>

<h2>MailChimp Integration</h2>

<p>So how difficult was it to get it to work with MailChimp. Not difficult at all. I just copied and pasted all of this html, nested table nonsense and it gave me the option to auto inline the css. Everything looked great, just as I expected it.</p>

  <li><a href="../../images/blog/2013/zurb-ink-mailchimp/mailchimp-preview-options-9e2c32ad.png"><img src="../../images/blog/2013/zurb-ink-mailchimp/mailchimp-preview-options-9e2c32ad.png" class="th" width="200"></a></li>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<p>If you have a paid monthly MailChimp account there is this great feature called inbox inspection. It is not instantaneous but it tests your email against either the top 10 email clients used on your list or your choice of 10. What is even better is that it is powered by Litmus, the same service that Zurb recommends for testing your emails. Just as a point of comparison, the cheapest Litmus account is the freelance account and it is $39 per month. Thank you MailChimp. If you are curious what types of results I got, check out the screenshots below.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>I have been using Ruby and RoR (Ruby on Rails) for the past couple of years and here are some of the things that I really appreciate about the language coming from a Java background.</p>

<p>Oh BTW, don&rsquo;t tell Java.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>1. Culture</h3>

<p>Ruby culture is fun and quirky. What other language has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why&#x27;s_(poignant)_Guide_to_Ruby">comic book</a> complete with <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/soundtrack/">soundtrack</a> as a basis for learning the language and is full of obscure cultural references.</p>

<h3>2. Simplicity</h3>

<p>The syntax that ruby provides is very elegant and succinct. Java is anything but simple, it is incredibly verbose and there is a lot of boilerplate code. Now when I am writing something in Java I feel like I am running extra laps. Even the simplified syntax of the <a href="http://processing.org/">processing core api</a> seems verbose next to ruby.</p>

<h3>3. Rails</h3>

<p>I have used PHP and CakePHP in the past and CakePHP is a great MVC framework but is as great of an experience in my opinion as rails. Add Devise, Zurb Foundation, Sass, Compass and others and you have a very tightly integrated environment to get started. rails db:migrate is just magical.</p>

<h3>4. Pry</h3>

<p>I might have put IRB here but Pry really solves a lot of the problems with IRB. But really, being about to experiment and run code on the fly, amazing. Pry lets you also do autocompletion, press . and get a list of all methods available, or an easy view of the ruby docs.</p>

<h3>5. Gem</h3>

<p>Although I think there is some validity in knowing how to build a unix app from scratch, I don&rsquo;t really want to do that all the time. Gem is an easy to use package manager that even lets you install specific versions of a package. Just gem update then gem install somegem and you are ready to go. If you can think it up, there is probally a gem for that.</p>

<h3>6. RVC</h3>

<p>A one line installer that does so much more. Want to run Ruby 1.9 and ruby 1.8 and switch between them. No problem, Rvc lets you do that with ease.</p>

<h3>7. Conditionals</h3>

<p>Its amazing how much more readable Ruby code can be and I think a great part of that is the conditional structures that are available.</p>

<ul>
<li>do this unless that</li>
<li>do this if that</li>
<li>unless that do this</li>
<li>if that do this</li>
</ul>

<p>How come Java doesn&rsquo;t have these structures. if (that != true) { //do this} seems so 1992.</p>

<h3>8. No semicolons, parens (), or blocks {}</h3>

<p>The indentation takes some getting used to, but I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I am missing a semicolon from a Java program. It can be inferurating. Also, getting unmatched parens and braces seems to just extraneous once you get used to ruby. I think a way to think about it is like how in English we drop all the words that can be assumed in a statement. Another benefit is white space and readability.</p>

<h3>9. erb + rails server</h3>

<p>The way that .erb works and with rails server is a very elegant solution for development. Basically a one line solution to run your server. I have worked with .jsp and tomcat in the past and lets just say, the ruby solution is much simpler for most development solutions.</p>

<p>Once you learn erb slim can be an even more elegant solution. Especially coupled with Zurb Foundation or Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

<h3>10. Community</h3>

<p>The ruby community is one of the most extensive around. If you have an idea of something you want to do that is web related, it is likely there is a ruby gem for that. There are meetups in most major cities, podcasts, and pretty much anything else you can think of. If you are die hard Java and have never given Ruby a change, I urge you. Check it out. Use it for a small project. You won&rsquo;t be sorry that you did.</p>

<p>Do you use ruby? What are some the parts about the language or ecosystem that you love. Let me know in the comments.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/ruby-slim-and-zurb-foundation/">Ruby Slim and Zurb Foundation</a> <span>Oct 29</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>Today I spent a lot of time working with Foundation and Bootstrap using Ruby Slim. If you haven&rsquo;t used slim before and you are still using erb or haml you should give it a try. If you love Emmet or Zencoding (which shall be referred from this point forward as Emmet) you will love slim. It is nearly the same format. For this Zurb Quicktip I will tell you how maintain your row structures for great Zurb Foundation presentational goodness.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I do a lot of work with static website generators and ruby based CMS systems such as <a href="http://www.middlemanapp.com">MiddleMan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nathanaeljones/hardwired">HardWired</a> so this technique will work well with either of them. If you are a seasoned Ruby veteran this may not be anything new to you.</p>

<p>Often I will create an array or a hash and cycle through it to automate the building of some sort of interface or content in a page. Normally this doesn&rsquo;t present much of a problem but Zurb Foundation and Twitter Bootstrap both have the issue of having to have row wrapper classes. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;large-12 columns&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;large-4 columns&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>This works out really great in slim as it does with Emmet.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">.row
  .large-12.columns
    .row
      .large-4.columns
         ...
</code></pre>

<p>Which ends up being very similar to Emmet.</p>

<pre><code class="html">.row&gt;.large-12.columns&gt;.row&gt;.large-4.columns&gt;...</code></pre>

<p>And so if you want to make these structures dynamic it is very easy. For example to populate a ul:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">- texts = [&quot;This is one thing&quot;, &quot;This is another thing&quot;, &quot;This is yet another thing&quot; &quot;This is thing 1&quot;, &quot;and this is thing 2&quot;, &quot;this is the last thing&quot;]
ul.side-nav
- texts.each do | t | 
  li
    a #{t}
</code></pre>

<p>An so this works really well for ul tags and other elements that can take an indeterminate number of elements. This becomes a problem however, when you want to use things like the standard Foundation 4 grid because of these pesky .row divs.</p>

<p>Maybe if you are like me, you might have considered using conditional statements with the each<em>with</em>index method. Maybe do a conditional on the modulus of the number of columns. The problem with this approach is that slim by its very nature is hierarchical which is great and also bad. Well bad in that the simple non ruby way doesn&rsquo;t work. Luckily Ruby has a great way to handle this situation and it is called the each_slice(n) method.</p>

<p>Lets take a look at how this plays out:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">- texts = [&quot;This is one thing&quot;, &quot;This is another thing&quot;, &quot;This is yet another thing&quot; &quot;This is thing 1&quot;, &quot;and this is thing 2&quot;, &quot;this is the last thing&quot;]
- number_of_columns = 3
- texts.each_slice(number_of_columns) do | text_block | 
  .row
    - text_block.each do | t | 
      .large-4.columns
        h1 #{t}
</code></pre>

<p>So here our texts.each_slice(n) method creates a code block which adds a row. This will give use nice arrays that have n elements (with the exception of the last one, which could be smaller). First we create a .row. Awesome. Next we create another block that traverses each element of the text block.</p>

<p>This is pretty nice. It only adds one line of code but allows use to get more granularity while maintaining a similar looping structure with the .each method as we used before.</p>

<p>This should keep your grid nice and tight and eliminate those pesky last divs that never seem to align right. Well, without their precious divs.</p>

<p>If you are new to Foundation or to using it with Ruby let me know if you have any other tips or questions. Don&rsquo;t forget to let me know in the comments if you have any questions about Foundation or have other topics you would like to hear about.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/dotrb-ruby-confrence-in-paris-france/">DotRB Ruby Conference in Paris, France</a> <span>Oct 23</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Last week I had the opportunity to attend the <a href="http://www.dotrb.eu">dotRB conference</a> in Paris, France. Beautiful venue, beautiful city and great food. Whats the catch? The organizer declared it a wifi (pronounced wee fee in French) free day, somewhat akin to being at a spa or on holiday. Since I still haven&rsquo;t quite figured out how to get a microsim <em>sans engagement</em> in Paris it took me a few more days to gather my thoughts in to a proper post.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>The Format</h2>

<p>The organizer of this event is going for a TED style tech conference with short 20 minute presentations that are more technical in nature. I really enjoyed most of the talks and I really enjoyed the humor, level of preparation, storytelling and delivery put forth by some of the speakers. I really admire the direction that this conference is taking and I hope they continue to refine their format and culture into the style of TED. Seems like they are off to quite a good start.</p>

<h2>The Speakers</h2>

<p>Really all the speakers are pretty big talent. It is pretty amazing to have everyone assembled under one roof. I am not going to give a play by play of each speaker but I wanted to point out some of the talks that I found very interesting and talk about why I thought they were very effective, for lack of a better way to define it, as technology or developer evangelism. I think that if you are interested in tech evangelism these are some really interesting people to watch. </p>

<h2>George Brocklehurst, ThoughtBot</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/georgebrock">@georgebrock</a></p>

<p>Georges presentation was fantastic. Having lived through the past tech-boom-burst-bubble the jokes were great. He starts off with some misdirection, letting you think he is talking about the bubble, but in reality he is describing Jurassic Park, the Movie. He builds up in his story to the scene where they are trapped by the Velociraptors and they need to shut the door. No problem, except for the fact that everything at Jurassic Park is controlled by computers, including the doors. Then, Lex stares at the computer for a moment and exclaims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a UNIX system! I know this!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great joke and he spun it in his joke to talk about how to write CLI (command line interface) programs in Ruby, how to package them in gems and how to make them work like people expect unix CLI programs to run. arguments, usage errors, stdout, stderr, and even got a bit into man pages. This can be some really boring stuff, but he really presented it in a way that made it fun, engaging and relevant. I have been interested in doing some basic part of this for some time. Sure I can look some of this up on my own, but there was something very important that came out of his talk. His enthusiasm for making CLI programs run the right way for everyone, because it was easy (in ruby) and he made it pretty fun.</p>

<p>Overall the pace was great and he threw in some other great jokes, taking his live coded CLI and piping it into <a href="http://www.figlet.org">figlet</a> I also especially enjoyed the way he built up talking about exit codes like they were totally arbitrary and they explained exactly how to get a hold of them in the man pages using the whatis command.</p>

<h2>Steve Klabnik, Free Agent</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have failed non-programmers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strong and very controversial title for his first slide. His premise is that programmers are projecting too much of what we [the programmers] want on other people. Programming with empathy. This was a very interesting proposition and I was on the hook wanting to know where he was going with this. He told a story about the transition from MS Word 5 to MS Word 6 and just after the downgrade to MS Word 5. At the time he was excited about all the features and all the cool ways it could be used, but his mom just wanted to use a word processor.</p>

<p>He also talked about how he is a serious command line but for most things he actually prefers his iPad. For me this was pretty personal, because I have a very similar feeling. There is something about using the iPad that is just fun and more natural. Not anything specific but just a feeling that I have, often coupled with the fear of losing geek status. </p>

<p>He then used this open the discussion about how he though the future was the browser and how the whole wed standards thing is broken. How there is no direct input and the people who are making the decisions are not the ones using it. He suggested an opposite approach, akin to making a jQuery Polyfill, that would then go native, then get added to browsers, then eventually get voted upon and implemented while retaining backwards compatibility with prefixes. Interesting proposition. Sounds to me like a much better solution.</p>

<p>Then a blast of super opinionated advice:</p>

<p>Rails:</p>

<ul>
<li>use apis only</li>
<li>use rails-api (its more rails than rails)</li>
<li>use json-api</li>
<li>use ember (everything he does is basicly a half ember app)</li>
<li>admit reality</li>
</ul>

<p>On the last point: rails is no longer hip, edgy or whatever. Its the safe choice and has job security and everyone needs to learn how to write JavaScript.</p>

<p>three closing points:</p>

<ul>
<li>use ember</li>
<li>build cool stuff</li>
<li>thanks for coming</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bryan Helmkamp, CodeClimate</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/brynary">@brynary</a></p>

<p>So what happens when things go wrong? We have all been there, live coding that is painful to watch, slides that don&rsquo;t work, etc. Its a reality that all public speakers are going to have to handle at one point or another. I personally had to deal with this when my mic channel was muted at the beginning of <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxPSU-James-Stone-A-Technolog">my talk at TEDxPSU</a>. Stuff happens.</p>

<p>At DotRB the projector failed and it took them several goes to get it going. Bryan was a champ and joked about how he hadn&rsquo;t done his pre-talk jumping jacks and then proceeded to do them in front of everyone. Hilarious, especially since it just seemed to take forever for them to get the projector sorted. Although he was a bit out of breath at the start he had already won the crowd over with his antics.</p>

<p>What followed was a really interesting talk about building a culture of code quality. He started off with a great analogy of a presenting problem as a medical term. He then described the symptoms as if they were told to a code doctor of slow progress, bugs and whack-a-mole. He stayed with the medical metaphors and called it a viscous cycle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Legacy code, n.
1. code written by anyone else
2. code written by you more than 2 weeks ago</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well how do you break that cycle? He proposes two things. 1) Do no harm. Don&rsquo;t introduce more poor quality code into your ecosystem. You are just making things worse and 2) the boy scout rule: leave things better than when you found them. So if you find something that is totally hosed, clean it up before you file your latest commit.</p>

<p>He also gave a lot of really great advice about improving code quality for teams. lunch and learn, team factoring, early warning systems, etc. He also mentioned that no one likes code reviews and that often people get put on the spot which was echoed by the following xkcdesqe comic.</p>

<p><img alt="WTF Per Min" src="http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">source</a></p>

<p>He proposes that instead of formal code reviews to do github pull requests. Why? They are non-blocking, asynchronous and opt-in. He suggests that you can change the Viscous Cycle into a Virtuous Cycle. Very interesting talk, hope he recovers from all of the pre-talk exercise.</p>

<h2>Erik Michaels-Ober, SoundCloud</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/sferik">@sferik</a></p>

<p>Erik was one of my favorite speakers and had one of the most unconventional talks. I mean, unconventional for a tech conf, but would be right in line at a TED or TEDx event. He didn&rsquo;t talk about code at all but rather technology in general and took a very optimistic historical approach. He started by talking about the big bang, by playing a sonification of it that, well, wasn&rsquo;t much of a bang. Pretty funny. His presentation was engaging, informative and very funny. He called some early Babylonian Sanskrit a proto-iPad, talked about how it was a beer recipe. He the talked about the inventions of papyrus, the printing press and the telegraph, each time explaining the cultural significance and some interesting facts. He talked about how the shift of power changed with these innovations and placed a different party in control. The point, today the richest companies are software companies and were are a part of the revolution.</p>

<p>Very interesting presentation and very inspiring.</p>

<h2>Developer Evangelism</h2>

<p>There were a lot of other really great talks but I wanted to focus on the ones that I thought were outstanding examples of developer evangelism. I encourage everyone who interfaces with other developers and gives talks to take a look at the videos once they are available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dotconferences">online</a>.</p>

<p>If you are asked to speak at an event, you have to remember that it isn&rsquo;t all technical. There is the human element. Sure, you need to nail that demo, but you also have to tell a good story. How do you tell a good story? Well, that can be a long story, right? But looking at story telling techniques, theatrics, humor, etc. can really go a long way. </p>

<p>Remember your audience. This is not some boring college presentation. Tell some nerdy jokes, wear a nerdy shirt. Go beyond the funny cat pics if you can.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t panic. If something goes wrong have a backup plan. Most importantly, give a great performance, inspire people and get them fired up about what you have to say. Remember, it is not just your product that you are pitching. It can also be a philosophy and a lifestyle. Put your own personal spin and passion on it.</p>

<p>If you were at the conference and were also inspired by these or other speakers I would love to hear about it in the comments. Do you have ideas about how to better present and talk with developers I would love to hear from you too.</p>

<p>I will leave you with my favorite quote from the event by Aaron Patterson at the Ruby Implementors Panel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m dead inside. I write C code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stay fired up. Hope to see you at <a href="http://www.dotjs.eu">DotJS in December</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/shoehorn-zurb-foundation-into-weird-stuff/">Shoehorn Zurb Foundation into Weird Stuff #1 MiddleMan</a> <span>Oct  2</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>Zurb Foundation is great. I mean really great. It is a Ruby Gem, it plays well with Rails and the Asset Pipeline. It even has its own generator to save you time. It also works well standalone with Compass and Sass from the command line but what happens when you try and use it with something else? Well, I will just come out and say it. Zurb Foundation doesn&rsquo;t always play well with others. In this Foundation Quicktip I will show how to get Zurb Foundation to play well with the excellent <a href="http://www.middlemanapp.com">MiddleMan</a> Ruby based static website and blog generator.</p>

<p></p>

<p>MiddleMan is a fantastic static website generator that runs under Ruby. It is what I use to run this site and is one of the most flexible and least opinionated options on the market. <a href="http://octopress.org">OctoPress</a> is much more popular, but just try and edit some of the basic themes. There is way more complexity in the templating system when compared to MiddleMan.</p>

<p>First lets add the zurb-foundation gem to our Gemfile:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">gem &quot;zurb-foundation&quot;, :require =&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p><span class="inline-code">:require =&gt; false</span> is needed here so it doesn&rsquo;t load up all of the dependencies of the <span class="inline-code">zurb-foundation</span> gem.</p>

<p>MiddleMan can use Compass and Sass to compile your files but it will not work with out some extra configuration. Lets take a look at the modifications I made to the <span class="inline-code">config.rb</span> file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">set :css_dir, 'stylesheets'
set :js_dir, 'javascripts'
set :images_dir, 'images'

foundation_path = Gem::Specification.find_by_name('zurb-foundation').gem_dir
set :js_assets_paths, [File.join(foundation_path, 'js')]
set :sass_assets_paths, [File.join(foundation_path, 'scss')]
</code></pre>

<p>A <a href="http://wanderwort.de/2013/04/11/using-zurb-foundation-with-middleman/">blog post by Roman Ernst</a> got me part way there. All that was needed was to add the :sass<em>assets</em>paths and everything works great.</p>

<p>Now lets take a look at my layout.erb file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html-ruby">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;!-- paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/ --&gt;
&lt;!--[if lt IE 7 ]&gt; &lt;html class="ie6" lang="en"&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if IE 7 ]&gt;    &lt;html class="ie7" lang="en"&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if IE 8 ]&gt;    &lt;html class="ie8" lang="en"&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;!--[if (gte IE 9)|!(IE)]&gt;&lt;!--&gt; &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Uncomment to make IE8 render like IE7 --&gt;
    &lt;!-- &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=7&quot; /&gt; --&gt;

    &lt;!-- Set the viewport width to device width for mobile --&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;&lt;%= current_page.data.title || &quot;James Stone&quot; %&gt;&lt;/title&gt;

    &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &quot;app&quot; %&gt;
    &lt;%= javascript_include_tag &quot;vendor/custom.modernizr&quot; %&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;

    &lt;%= partial &quot;header&quot; %&gt;
    &lt;%= yield %&gt;
    &lt;%= partial &quot;footer&quot; %&gt;
    &lt;%= javascript_include_tag  &quot;application&quot; %&gt;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This should look pretty familiar if you use the Assets Pipeline / Sprokets in Rails. The only difference here is that we want to load vendor/custom.modernizr.js at the top of the page separately so I made a copy from the original gem file to my javascripts/vendor directory. You can find the path of to your current zurb-foundation gem(s) by running <span class="inline-code">gem which zurb-foundation</span>. The javascripts can be found one level down in the <span class="inline-code">../js/vendor</span> directory.</p>

<p>Now lets move on to our app.js file.</p>

<blockquote class="panel">
    <p>This is a manifest file that&#039;ll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files listed below.</p>
    <p>Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts, or vendor/assets/javascripts of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.</p>
    <p>It&#039;s not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it&#039;ll appear at the bottom of the the compiled file.</p>
    <p>WARNING: THE FIRST BLANK LINE MARKS THE END OF WHAT&#039;S TO BE PROCESSED, ANY BLANK LINE SHOULD GO AFTER THE REQUIRES BELOW.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the message in the comments of this file generated by MiddleMan that I have removed, for your reference.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">//= require vendor/jquery
//= require foundation/foundation
//= require foundation/foundation.clearing
//= require foundation/foundation.abide
//= require foundation/foundation.forms
//= require foundation/foundation.section
//= require vendor/highlight
//= require vendor/processing
//= require_directory .

$(document).foundation();

// other code I want to load every page, such as my code highlighting library
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple things going on here. First, I am deciding to use jQuery only<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> for my site because I have some jQuery specific functionality that is not compatible with Zepto. Second, you will notice that I am only including a subset of the full Foundation JavaScripts. This is because I am optimizing it by not including features that I am not using on my site. Finally I load two additional libraries I am using, highlight and processing from the vendor directory. Finally I have changed <span class="inline-code">//=require-all</span> to <span class="inline-code">//=require_directory .</span> This is important to prevent Sprokets from requesting all of our Foundation JavaScript files from the gem file. Now it will only look at the current directory for files to compile at the end of this file.</p>

<p>Against the suggestion of the MiddleMen I just place my JavaScript in the file, starting with the <span class="inline-code">$(document).foundation()</span> jQuery Plugin call.</p>

<p>Now, we are almost set to go but there is one more thing. Sassy CSS or SCSS. To get this working I have copied over the <span class="inline-code">../scss/normalize.scss</span> and <span class="inline-code">../scss/foundation/variables.scss</span> files from the gem file and renamed them with a prefixed underscore. </p>

<p>Here is the contents of my app.scss file:</p>

<pre><code class="langugage-sass">// Global Foundation Settings
@import &quot;settings&quot;;

// Comment out this import if you don&#039;t want to use normalize
@import &quot;normalize&quot;;

// Import specific parts of Foundation by commenting the import &quot;foundation&quot;
// and uncommenting what you want below. You must uncomment the following if customizing

@import &quot;foundation/components/global&quot;; // *always required
@import &quot;foundation/components/grid&quot;;

// Use this grid if you want to start using the new Foundation 5 grid early.
// It will change breakpoints to min-width: 640px and 1024px.
// @import &quot;foundation/components/grid-5&quot;;

// @import &quot;foundation/components/tooltips&quot;;
// @import &quot;foundation/components/dropdown&quot;;
@import &quot;highlight-styles/solarized_dark&quot;;
</code></pre>

<p>Here I have left all of my commented out <span class="inline-code">@import</span> statements because when Sprokets renders the CSS it removes all <span class="inline-code">//</span> style comments and only preserves <span class="inline-code">/* */</span> style comments. After all of my Foundation <span class="inline-code">@imports</span> I place all of my site specific Sass and CSS.</p>

<p>This has been working really well for me so far. First it is using the latest version of Foundation from the gem file and only requires minimal config changes to my MiddleMan <span class="inline-code">config.rb</span> file. I can just run <span class="inline-code">middleman server</span> and it will recompile scss changes on the fly so they are reflected immediately on my development server. Another great benefit it is the Sprokets assets system that provides a best practice creating a single concatenated and minified javascript and css file per site.</p>

<p>I host everything on AWS S3 / CloudFront and use the <span class="inline-code">middleman-s3_sync</span> gem to keep everything up to date.</p>

<p>If you have been using MiddleMan with Foundation or have any questions please feel free to get in touch through the comments below. Is there something strange you are trying to get Foundation Sass to work with? Let me know in the comments and I might featured it in a future post.</p>

<p>[<a name="note1">1</a>] jQuery only: If you want to have the default behavior of Foundation choosing Zepto or jQuery automatically, you can approach it as I did with the custom.modernizr.js file.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/semantic-ui-style-layouts-in-zurb-foundation/">Semantic UI Style Grids in Zurb Foundation</a> <span>Sep 28</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>This is the first in a series of Foundation Quicktips, short articles that solve practical problems. Lately <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a> has been the buzz around HN and the like and there is good reason. The UI elements look fantastic and they provide a new style &ldquo;semantic&rdquo; markup that make things like 3 column grids more readable in HTML. I am a big fan of more readable code, so lets take a look at how to accomplish the same thing using Zurb Foundation 4 Sass Mixins.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First lets take a look at the example for Semantic UI:</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;div class=&quot;ui three column grid&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>What I think is really great about this syntax is it is very readable. It is very clear that what I have is a 3 column layout and that each column of content is clearly delineated. It is very easy to recreate this functionality with Sass in F4.</p>

<style type="text/css"> @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {.three-column-grid {width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; max-width: 62.5em; *zoom: 1; } .three-column-grid:before, .three-column-grid:after {content: " "; display: table; } .three-column-grid:after {clear: both; } .three-column-grid .column {position: relative; padding-left: 0.9375em; padding-right: 0.9375em; width: 33.33333%; float: left; } .four-column-grid {width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; max-width: 62.5em; *zoom: 1; } .four-column-grid:before, .four-column-grid:after {content: " "; display: table; } .four-column-grid:after {clear: both; } .four-column-grid .column {position: relative; padding-left: 0.9375em; padding-right: 0.9375em; width: 25%; float: left; } } @media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {.three-column-grid {width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; max-width: 62.5em; *zoom: 1; } .three-column-grid:before, .three-column-grid:after {content: " "; display: table; } .three-column-grid:after {clear: both; } .three-column-grid .column {position: relative; padding-left: 0.9375em; padding-right: 0.9375em; width: 100%; float: left; } .four-column-grid {width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; max-width: 62.5em; *zoom: 1; } .four-column-grid:before, .four-column-grid:after {content: " "; display: table; } .four-column-grid:after {clear: both; } .four-column-grid .column {position: relative; padding-left: 0.9375em; padding-right: 0.9375em; width: 50%; float: left; } } </style>

<pre><code class="CSS">$medium-up: &quot;only screen and (max-width:&quot;#{$small-screen}&quot;)&quot;;
@media #{$small} { 
  .three-column-grid { @include grid-row(); }
  .three-column-grid .column { @include grid-column(4); }
}
@media #{$medium-up} {
  .three-column-grid { @include grid-row(); }
  .three-column-grid .column { @include grid-column(12); }
}</code></pre>

<p>Working with Media Queries in Foundation can be confusing at times. What I do is just remember it is the opposite of what I think. In this case I created a new Sass variable named <span class="inline-code">$medium-up</span> to match the visibility presentational classes in Foundation. Then, the first media query, named <span class="inline-code">$small</span> is the Large or Desktop Grid. This is similar to classes such as <span class="inline-code">.large-4 .columns</span> which is what we are emulating. Likewise the <span class="inline-code">$medium-up</span> is for the small or mobile grid.</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;div class=&quot;three-column-grid&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see how close we are getting to the original concept. Where Semantic UI is a framework and uses multiple classes to accomplish the same thing, we are using just one. This will keep us from polluting our CSS class names and avoid any potential overlap with Foundation. Foundation uses the <span class="inline-code">.columns</span> class so it is safe to use <span class="inline-code">.column</span>, although you might want to change it to prevent confusion in the future.</p>

<pre><code class="CSS">@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .three-column-grid {
    width: 100%;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-top: 0;
    margin-bottom: 0;
    max-width: 62.5em;
    *zoom: 1;
  }
  .three-column-grid:before, .three-column-grid:after {
    content: &amp;quot; &amp;quot;;
    display: table;
  }
  .three-column-grid:after {
    clear: both;
  }
  .three-column-grid .column {
    position: relative;
    padding-left: 0.9375em;
    padding-right: 0.9375em;
    width: 33.33333%;
    float: left;
  }
}
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  .three-column-grid {
    width: 100%;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-top: 0;
    margin-bottom: 0;
    max-width: 62.5em;
    *zoom: 1;
  }
  .three-column-grid:before, .three-column-grid:after {
    content: &amp;quot; &amp;quot;;
    display: table;
  }
  .three-column-grid:after {
    clear: both;
  }
  .three-column-grid .column {
    position: relative;
    padding-left: 0.9375em;
    padding-right: 0.9375em;
    width: 100%;
    float: left;

<p>If we take a look at our generated CSS you will see this is where Foundation really shines. We can override the generation of presentational classes at this point on line 88 of our <span class="inline-code">_settings.scss</span> file, by changing it to <span class="inline-code">$include-html-classes: false;</span> Of course you should only do this if you are not using any other presentational classes in other parts of your page, but the advantage should be clear. Our generated CSS file is dramatically smaller and we have removed a lot of the bloat. You can also selectively remove parts of the generated presentational classes with the settings that follow line 88.</p>

<p>In our example below, with nested panels to show the functionality, you can see we get a nice 3 column layout with stacking on mobile, much like the default behavior of Foundation.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="small-10 small-centered large-10 columns example">

    <div class="three-column-grid">
      <div class="column">
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Unde, doloribus, rem, error in tempore quaerat quia explicabo aspernatur hic eligendi est ipsum quo nemo nulla!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Dolorem, perspiciatis minima necessitatibus illo tempora ea dolor debitis ab vitae nihil consequatur nulla sunt error non quibusdam architecto laboriosam aspernatur modi ex libero earum.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Vitae, reiciendis, tempora voluptates accusamus numquam eum dolorem minima recusandae ratione suscipit. Porro, laboriosam, enim adipisci soluta repellat alias ab consequuntur corporis repudiandae magnam. Pariatur!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Lets take this one step further and create a four column layout, another common design pattern in web design. Lets make one change however, we will make it so it displays 2-up on mobile. This is really easy to implement in Sass.</p>

<pre><code class="CSS"> $medium-up: &quot;only screen and (max-width:&quot;#{$small-screen}&quot;)&quot;;
@media #{$small} { 
  .three-column-grid { @include grid-row(); }
  .three-column-grid .column { @include grid-column(4); }
  .four-column-grid { @include grid-row(); }
  .four-column-grid .column { @include grid-column(3); }
}
@media #{$medium-up} {
  .three-column-grid { @include grid-row(); }
  .three-column-grid .column { @include grid-column(12); }
  .four-column-grid { @include grid-row(); }
  .four-column-grid .column { @include grid-column(6); }
} </code></pre>

<p>The only difference here is that we changed our <span class="inline-code">@include grid-column()</span> to 3 from 4 for our Desktop/Large Grid and to 6 from 12 for our Mobile/Small Grid. This is pretty simple math. Just take your total columns 12 and divide by the number of desired columns. 12 / 3 = 4 so 4 columns wide for three columns and 12 / 4 = 3 which leaves 3 columns wide for the four column layout. Pretty smart that Zurb gave us a 12 columns wide grid by default.</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;div class=&quot;three-column-grid&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;four-column-grid&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;4&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With our layouts complete we can now use these anywhere on our site or app and get a nice readable CSS class name such as <span class="inline-code">three-column-grid</span> or <span class="inline-code">four-column-grid</span>. Semantic UI is super cool and definitely worth a look at but you don&rsquo;t have to envy its semantic grid classes. Just roll your own with Zurb Foundation 4 and Sass.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>Last night I was chatting with <a href="http://jeffreyhorn.com/">Jeffrey Horn</a> and found out he was at Startup Weekend in Seattle and working on a new project called <a href="http://404kids.org/">four04kids</a>. Pretty cool idea, they encourage you to add a simple javascript to your 404 error page and it asks if you have seen missing children in your area. I thought this was a great idea and something really positive they were bringing to the community and added their js embed to <a href="http://www.manofstone.com/WAT">my error page on this site</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I chatted with him for a bit about their future directions and that a jQuery Plugin version was in the road map. In the spirit of Open Source and Gitrdone I jumped in to refactor their existing code into a proper jQuery Plugin to the best of my ability. What follows is what I learned in the several hour process and how I implemented the Event Driven jQuery Plugin Pattern as written about by Doug Avery in his excellent article titled, <a href="http://viget.com/inspire/jquery-plugin-patterns">A Few jQuery Plugin Patterns</a> on the <a href="http://viget.com/inspire/">Viget Inspire Blog</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions on how to refactor this I would love to hear from you in the comments. This is just the solution I built with the time I had available.</p>

<p>So I took a look at the <a href="https://github.com/theverything/four04kids/blob/270618d3cca97b2d4392e745e9c610082d361a80/embed/src/embed.coffee">original javascript</a> at had a go at it.</p>

<p>I broke it down into the following pieces of functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Loading JSON data via the API</li>
<li>Going to the next kid, excluding the last viewed on when the &ldquo;no&rdquo; button is pressed</li>
<li>Adding custom CSS</li>
<li>Replacing or adding a DIV and filling a template with data from it</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets take a look at the full source in CoffeeScript:</p>

<pre><code class="coffeescript">$.fn.four04 = (options) -&gt;
  settings = $.extend(
    wrapperClass: &quot;kids404-wrapper&quot;

    htmlTemplate: &quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;div class=&quot;{{wrapperClass}}&quot;&gt;

    $this.ready -&gt; # show the first kid after everything else
      $this.trigger &quot;newKid&quot;      

</code></pre>

<p>First I define some defaults that can be overrided when calling the plugin. In these defaults I also place a mustache template called htmlTemplate. Next, by calling <span class="inline-code">@each</span> allows jQuery calls to be chained to this plugin. The function <span class="inline-code">newKid (kid_id)</span> does a lot of the heavy lifting, pulling the data from json and returning the template. Following this I bind <span class="inline-code">newKid</span> to <span class="inline-code">$this</span>. Finally <span class="inline-code">$this.ready</span> calls newKid with <span class="inline-code">$this.trigger &ldquo;newKid&rdquo;</span>.</p>

<p>I moved the adding of the trigger to the &ldquo;No&rdquo; button to the end of the <span class="inline-code">.done()</span> callback for the <span class="inline-code">getJSON</span> method. This ensures that the button has been created by the template before binding it to the correct function. If you try and do this in another part of the plugin, such as in the same scope as <span class="inline-code">$this.bind</span> the problem is that the button has not been created yet, because we are waiting for the <span class="inline-code">getJSON</span> call to complete.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/design-patterns-in-processing-the-agent/">Design Patterns in Processing, the Agent</a> <span>Sep 14</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>No this is not the GoF. You won&rsquo;t find Singletons or Factories or anything like that here. What I am attempting to define and describe are patterns used in Processing (p5) which could also be used in similar languages, libraries or applications that use OOP and have a game style loop.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>So what is the Agent and what is it used for?</h2>

<p>The Agent is a way of abstracting the idea of a physical object, or rather something that is a representation of a physical object within our 2d/3d graphical world created in Processing. This Agent is self aware and supporting and contains everything it needs in order to interact with its world. It is often placed in an <span class="inline-code">ArrayList</span> with many tens, hundreds or thousands of its kind. It is the building block for many patterns in Processing and is similar to that of the Movie Clip from old school Adobe Flash.</p>

<p>Lets take a look at the basic Agent pattern:</p>

<pre><code data-language="java">class Agent {
  PVector location;
  PVector velocity;
  PVector target;

  Agent() {
    location = new PVector();
  }

  Agent(float _x, float _y) {
    this();
    location.x = _x;
    location.y = _y;
  }

  void calc() { }

  void display() { }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The keystone of our Agent class are the <span class="inline-code">PVector location, velocity, target</span> variables. These hold the current location of our Agent as well as its current velocity and targeting vector, if used.</p>

<p>Next we define our constructors. Another pattern you might see used a lot in Processing and Processing Libraries is chaining of multiple constructors. Basically, you can call <span class="inline-code">this()</span> or <span class="inline-code">super()</span> in the case of an inherited class to call the main constructor, usually where you instantiate objects contained within the class. In this case are going to instantiate our <span class="inline-code">PVector location</span>.</p>

<p>At the end we have two skeleton methods <span class="inline-code">void calc()</span> and <span class="inline-code">void display()</span>. The plan here is to call each method once per frame in our Processing / game style loop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might be thinking, why have the <span class="inline-code">calc()</span> method? It seems easy enough to just do our calculations within our <span class="inline-code">display()</span> method. The reason you want to keep these methods separate is that it allows more flexibly in how your objects can be used. For example, if you want to do a time lapse video of your sketch, you can just call <span class="inline-code">calc()</span> n times for every frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now lets take a look at how this works with a simple example. In this series I will be using an iterative approach by adding functionality and behavior by sometimes experimenting outside the Agent class followed by refactoring desired traits within Agent.</p>

<p>First, we must create some agents and place them somewhere on our grid.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="medium-8 large-8 columns">
<pre><code data-language="java">class Agent {
  PVector location;
  PVector velocity;
  PVector target;

  Agent() {
    location = new PVector();
  }

  Agent(float _x, float _y) {
    this();
    location.x = _x;
    location.y = _y;
  }

  void calc() {
    // do nothing, yet
  }

  void display() {
    pushMatrix();
      translate(location.x, location.y);
      // draw stuff
      ellipse(0,0,50,50);
    popMatrix();
  }
}

// globals

ArrayList&lt;Agent&gt; agents;
int numberOfAgents = 100;

void setup(){
  size(512, 512);
  agents = new ArrayList&lt;Agent&gt;();
  for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; numberOfAgents; i++) {
    Agent a = new Agent(random(0,width), random(0,height));
    agents.add(a);
  }
}

void draw(){
  background(127);
  for (Agent a: agents) {
    a.display();
  }
}
</code></pre>

  </div>
  <div class="medium-4 large-4 columns">
<div class="processing-js-canvas">
    <canvas id="design_pattern_agent_basic" data-processing-sources="design_pattern_agent_basic.pde">
    </canvas>
 </div>

  </div>
</div>

<p><br></p>

<p>At this point we haven&rsquo;t really gone too much further but it is important to explain how we would use our Agent class out in the wild. You might be thinking that the <span class="inline-code">array</span> is the best place to keep them. Even though this is what they teach  in countless books and classes on Processing it is the wrong approach. You are almost always better off to use an ArrayList right from the start.</p>

<p>Let explain to you why this is the case:</p>

<ul>
<li>ArrayLists allow for concise iteration that is much more readable</li>
<li>ArrayLists allow for quick and easy removal of elements via <span class="inline-code">ArrayList.remove(0)</span> or <span class="inline-code">ArrayList.remove(n)</span></li>
<li>ArrayLists allow for quick and easy expansion of elements via <span class="inline-code">ArrayList.add()</span></li>
<li>ArrayLists can be accessed non-sequentially using <span class="inline-code">ArrayList.get(n)</span></li>
<li>ArrayLists have been known to mutate and create amazing emergent art completely on their own</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, this is all true except for that last point. Lets take a look at both approaches side-by-side to better understand the differences and to hopefully cast aside our bad array habits once and for all:</p>

<p><br></p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="medium-5 large-5 columns">
<pre><code data-language="java">// init
ArrayList&lt;Agent&gt; agents;

// instantiate
agents = new ArrayList&lt;Agent&gt;();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
  Agent a = new Agent();
  agents.add(a);
}

// iterate
for (Agent a: agents) {
  a.display();
}

// remove last element
agents.remove(agents.size());

// remove first element
agents.remove(0);

// add one additional element
agents.add(new Agent());
</code></pre>

  </div>
  <div class="medium-2 large-2 columns">
    <h2 align="center">vs.</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="medium-5 large-5 columns">
<pre><code data-language="java">// init
Agent[] agents;

// instantiate
agents = new agents[n];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
  Agent a = new Agent();
  agents[i] = a;
}

// iterate
for (int i = 0; i &lt; agents.length; i++) {
  agents[i].display();
}

// remove last element
agents = (Agent[]) shorten(agents);

// remove first element
agents = (Agent[]) subset(agents, 1, agents.length);

// add one additional element
agents = (Agent[]) expand(agents, agents.length + 1);
agents[agents.length] = new Agent();
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Although things start off looking pretty similar one can easily identify the complexity of the syntax and the repetition of having to use the processing helper methods (not to knock these, they are great if you are in a pinch and stuck with an array to deal with) along with constantly casting your arrays can be less than ideal.</p>

<p>Lets continue our journey by adding some simple behavior and also tune our performance along the way. Take our next example:</p>

<pre><code data-language="java">class Agent {
  PVector location;
  PVector velocity;
  PVector target;
  float   agentSize;
  int     agentColor;

  Agent() {
    location = new PVector();
    velocity = new PVector();
    agentSize = 50;
    agentColor = 255;
  }

  Agent(float _x, float _y) {
    this();
    location.x = _x;
    location.y = _y;
  }

  Agent(float _x, float _y, float _vx, float _vy) {
    this(_x, _y);
    velocity.x = _vx;
    velocity.y = _vy;
  }

  Agent(float _x, float _y, float _vx, float _vy, float _agentSize) {
    this(_x, _y);
    velocity.x = _vx;
    velocity.y = _vy;
    agentSize = _agentSize;
  }

  void calc() {
    location.add(velocity);
    // bounds
    if (location.y &gt; height) {
      velocity.y *= -0.75; // flip vector to 75% of previous
    }
    if (location.x &gt; width || location.x &lt; 0) {
