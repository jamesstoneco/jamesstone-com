  text: "I really enjoyed working with James because he cared about staying true to the design and taking time to get clarity about the ui elements and intended interactions. It was nice to be able to rely on his expertise with development and his thoughtful suggestions. He’s very communicative and easy to reach which is really important when you’re trying to hit tight deadlines! It’s rare to find someone who is both an expert in his field and very open to feedback and critique to help you get the best design."

  text: "It's not easy being a self-funded start-up, especially when going it alone. James has  became an integral part of my team, sharing his knowledge of web development and making valuable recommendations.  What stands out for me is the wonderful experience that James was able to create.  He broke from the industry standard of long, boring, wordy forms for customizing books and instead created a sleek, easy-to-use app that we've named the &ldquo;Character Builder.&rdquo; The site is truly user-friendly and the design is very clean, not dizzying like many other sites selling children's products.  I would venture to guess that James' MFA helped drive the creative solutions to problems we faced."
