### Creating a Mobile Specific Experience

So what happens if you hit a wall using the mobile grid, push, pull and offset classes? What happens if you want to push it farther and create a specialized mobile user experience?

In a perfect world you would have feature parity amongst your different view ports and device types. But in reality you often need to tweak things beyond the grid. This can come in two flavors, a mobile specific experience and desktop enhancement.

In both cases when prototyping the quickest way to tackle this situation is by using the visibility classes. There are a bunch of them, so I will show you a quick way to handle our two use cases.

First lets look at a mobile specific user experience.

One of the most common patterns that I have seen, is to use the navbar on desktop but show an the off-canvas menu on mobile. If you are not sure what I am talking about, take a look at the foundation website both in a desktop browser and then with our chrome mobile device emulator.

This patter is a bit more complex because of the wrapping of the off canvas menu, but other than that, the use of visibility classes is exactly the same.

Lets take a look at the source from the foundation site:
