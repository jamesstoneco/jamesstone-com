# Bringing Home the Yeti

ZURB Foundation is an amazing piece of open source software but it is not the easiest to install and get started with. That is why the first lesson, or pre-lesson starts with setting up a proper development environment.

But wait, you might say, I have already installed XCode (on macosx), Ruby, Node, Bower and Grunt. Nice job, click here to jump directly to the next lesson (however you might be interested in the what is ZURB Foundation video below).

Now if you found that paragraph in anyway confusing, don’t worry, you are in the right place.

In modern web development you touch a lot of technologies. The good news is you don’t have to know everything perfectly in order to get started. The also good news is you are probally going to have to remember a bunch of cool names — I recommend adorning your laptop with project stickers as you learn them.

But before we get started with the installation, its a good idea to review what ZURB Foundation is and also what it is not. Below I have prepared a short introduction to Foundation and its related technologies.

So now you know what Ruby, Ruby Gem, Node, NPM, Bower, Grunt and the Foundation CLI is. Awesome, now lets get those installed on your system.

Take the red pill and install on Mac OS X 10.8+

Take the blue pill and install on Windows 7+ 

(Aw, Snap! My screencast for windows got corrupted. I am creating a new one, but if you need help with this, email me directly and I will help you out personally, just hit reply)

So at this point you should be able to open the terminal on macosx or the console on windows and type:

`foundation new drawTheYeti —libsass`

If you hit enter you should hear some whiring and chirping and plain text should start running down the screen. If you have seen the original Jurrassic Park you might remember the line “this is unix, I know this.”

By the end of the course, my hope is if you are being chased by Velociraptors and suddenly need to create a ZURB Foundation project to save the day, you will do it with pizaze and come up with your own one-liner for us all to remember you by.

So now, armed with the latest and greatest CLI provided by the ZURB Foundation core team, I ask you, “are you ready to rock it with Foundation?” If your answer is yes then click here to start the next lesson where you will learn the most common patterns of the grid.
