Welcome to the course and my goal is to make sure your ZURB Foundation learning experience is a fruitful one. By the end of this course you should be well prepared to start prototyping and building out professional production quality sites and apps at a fraction of the time, using ZURB Foundation of course.

My name is James Stone and I am the author of ZURB Foundation Blueprints (Packt Publishing), an Official ZURB Certified Preferred Professional and a top contributor to the project. I have been using ZURB Foundation since version 3 (Bootstrap since version 2.3) and I know the internals and proâ€™s and cons of both frameworks.

The goal of this guide is to give you a set of tools that you can use to go beyond the template.

There are lots of people that can cobble together a site using a variety of templates either paid or free. There is nothing wrong with that and in fact, if you can find a good template that gets you most of the way there and is within your budget, I would even advise you, go for it. 

But there will come a time, maybe that time is right now, that you will want to do something that this template does not provide. I think it is important for any web professional to get past just using templates. The goal of this course is to give you a set of tools that you can use to build any website in any style.

Whether that comes from pixel perfect mocks in Photoshop or Sketch 3 from your design team, from a bunch of quick paper sketches and wireframes using a Sharpie, or a set of Basalmic Wireframes you were handed to start building out the front-end on.

Personally, I run a small consultancy where I focus both on advising and implementation. My work has me building a wide range of graphic styles across a gamut of different industries.

Much like a larger agency like ZURB, I have to be nimble and prepared to build out just about anything that can be thrown at me.

ZURB Foundation is a lot more powerful than you think, you just have learn how to harness it correctly.
