## Use Mixins, but Don’t Go Full On Semantic

So maybe you have read about Semantic HTML and Sass Mixins. There is nothing wrong with going down that road, but using the ZURB Sass Mixins is a lot more simple than they would let on.

If you have used a programming language before, Sass Mixin’s are a lot like functions or proceedures. You have a series of paramenters that can be given to the function and it exports CSS based on that.

There are three categories I typically run into:

1. Make specific stylistic changes to one instance of a Foundation component, without effecting the rest of the same components used in the project. For example, maybe I would want to create a different colored accordian with tighter padding and margins than the rest that would be used in a darker sidebar.
2. Combine or have strong customization for a ZURB Foundation compontent.
3. Apply ZURB Foundation styles to predefined classes such as those used by a CMS such as WordPress or Drupal.
