## Learn Common Patterns of the Grid

Maybe you have taken a look at the ZURB Foundation Grids and became a bit overwhelmed. ZURB Foundation is built by the ZURB, a Product Design Agency, and has a strong focus towards Designers.

If you haven’t come from a Design background where you had a lot of experience working with grid systems, say in print, it can be a bit confusing.

Well, it doesn’t have to be. About 90% of the time you use a small subset of patterns that are commonly used on the web. Below I will outline the most common ones.

### Full width

'' .medium-12.columns
'' 
'' <div class=“medium-12 columns"></div>

### Half width

'' .medium-6.columns*2
'' 
'' <div class="medium-6 columns"></div>
'' <div class="medium-6 columns"></div>

### 3-column

'' .medium-4.columns*3
'' 
'' <div class="medium-4 columns"></div>
'' <div class="medium-4 columns"></div>
'' <div class="medium-4 columns"></div>

### 4-column

'' .medium-3.columns*4
'' 
'' <div class="medium-3 columns"></div>
'' <div class="medium-3 columns"></div>
'' <div class="medium-3 columns"></div>
'' <div class="medium-3 columns"></div>

### 2/3 split aka “golden ratio”

First content on the left and sidebar on the right:

'' .medium-8.columns+.medium-4.columns
'' 
'' <div class="medium-8 columns"></div>
'' <div class="medium-4 columns"></div>

Or if you flip it around, sidebar on the left and content on the right.

'' .medium-4.columns+.medium-8.columns
'' 
'' <div class="medium-4 columns"></div>
'' <div class="medium-8 columns"></div>

Be sure to check out the [live example on CodePen].

**But where do you start: with large, medium or small?**

You should almost always start with medium and use the Desktop First Workflow, which will be discussed in detail in the next section.
