### Viewing and Testing Your Mobile Sites

Many people will just resize their browser arbitrarily to change the breakpoints. I think this is not the best way to judge the behavior of your responsive site.

Instead I advocate coming up with a device persona for your site. For example on many sites I use an iPhone 4 as that persona. 

I chose a specific one for each project, ideally from data on screen sizes from Google Analytics.  A good way to get at this data is to use the custom report in [this article by Kiss Metrics]. 

NOTE: you will need to drill down by clicking on mobile to see the resolution rankings.

SPECIAL NOTE: be sure to watch out for bad data from http referral spam emulating mobile devices + resolutions.)

If you don’t have any data to start from, I would suggest using the iPhone 3g for general US demographics including the Midwest and the iPhone 4 for younger more tech savvy audiences such as larger cities on the coasts.

Once you have your project mobile device persona set, fire up the emulator in Chrome and use this while you go through the entire refinement stage.

Here is a [good tutorial on Sitepoint] if you have never used it.

It is important because you will see what is above the fold and will get a better idea of how it will be to interact with your site on a mobile device.

### Refining the Mobile Grid

Today in ZF5 you have 3 grids but you want to be as minimal in your use as possible. 

So if you have started with your medium grid, that is to force the tablet layout to be the same (usually what you would want). 

By adding small classes you are overriding that default stacking behavior.

> Quicktip: you should never add .small-12.columns to any other existing grid, as it can be inferred from the other grid setting, such as .medium-n or .large-n
 
So the first thing you want to look for is where does it make sense to have the mobile grid mimic the desktop grid. Often headers, navigation and the media object pattern. 

The Media Object pattern is an image (such as a profile image) to the left of a headline and descriptive text.

For these, just match the same grid and see how it looks on mobile. These are great to get out of the way first, as you get them for free with minimal changes.

The second thing you want to look at is the stacking order. Are there elements being stacked in an order that doesn’t make logical sense?

Often images alongside content, especially if the design is alternated suffers from this. On mobile devices, typically it is going to look best if you have your image, then your headline and then your body copy, in that order.

If you find your images flip-flopped out of order you can use the push and pull classes to rearrange the order, specifically on mobile. 

In order to do this you have to first change the order on desktop into the order that you want them to appear on mobile.

You can see the issue below first hand [in this CodePen]. Make sure you resize to have the mobile breakpoints (small) apply.

Now lets take a look at the solution:

'' .row>.medium-4.columns.medium-push-8+medium-8.columns.medium-pull-4
'' 
''   <div class="row">
''     <div class="medium-4 columns medium-push-8">
''           <img src="http://www.placehold.it/640x480&text=image2" alt="" />
''     </div>
''     <div class="medium-8 columns medium-pull-4">
''       <h3>Refined Layout on Mobile.</h3>
''       <p> ... </p>
''     </div>
''   </div>

What we are doing here is placing the content in the order that we want it to appear on mobile, the small grid, then flip-flopping it on desktop by using the push and pull classes.

There is something about how you use these classes that is a bit counter intuitive. I always remember that I want to push then pull and that the push takes the number of columns from the opposite column and vise versa.

[Here is the solution on CodePen]. Be sure to resize the browser to trigger the different breakpoints.

So now you should be on your way to a more intuitive mobile layout by simply reflowing your content. 

This is always my first stage response when it comes to mobile refinement. Sometimes you need to take things a bit farther.

In the next lesson I am going to talk about how you can create a mobile specific experience using the visibility classes.
