    This is my personal blog. It is focused on working with modern web technology. My philosophy is that if you want to build great products, you must have great idea([ation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449334911/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449334911&linkCode=as2&tag=jamestonport-20)), [stay hungry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA), [stay foolish](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/44538/what-does-the-phrase-stay-hungry-stay-foolish-mean) and [ship](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt).

    My goal is to provide you with insightful, relevant articles that you can implement today in your projects. I write about technology, creativity and marketing. Occasionally I might talk about software or tools that I found that are useful.

    If you are excited about the modern web and all the possibilities it holds, then this blog is for you.

    I typically post once or twice a week. To make sure you donâ€™t miss my newest posts, you can subscribe via [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/jamesmanofstone) or [e-mail](/subscribe).

    ### My Contact Information

    You can contact me via [e-mail](mailto:jamesmanofstone@gmail.com) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manofstone), [GitHub](https://github.com/manofstone), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1560583/manofstone) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/manofstone).

    ### Colophon

    This site is built using [Middleman 3](http://middlemanapp.com/) and the [middleman-blog gem](http://middlemanapp.com/blogging/). It is a free open source static site generator and it is pretty awesome. I also use the amazing [Zurb Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) Responsive Web Framework along with its dependancy of [jQuery 2](http://jquery.com/). I also use the [TimeAgo jQuery plugin](http://timeago.yarp.com/), [Highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/) and [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/). I use the [image-optim](https://github.com/toy/image_optim) gem for image optimization and the [middleman-deploy gem](https://github.com/tvaughan/middleman-deploy) for easy rsync to my server.

    The template is one that I have custom created for this site and if you are interested at all about how any of this works, I have posted the entire source on GitHub.

    This site is hosted on a [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) 12.04 LTS server at [RackSpace](http://www.rackspace.com/) using [nginx](http://nginx.org/) and configured for maximum performance. RackSpace is not for the faint of heart. For an easier hosting solution I suggest [dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/) or [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
