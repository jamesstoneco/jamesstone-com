    <h4>Artist Statement</h4>
    <p>As an artist I am attracted to systems that can be defined by simple behaviors that create aesthetically interesting and complex art. My art practice focuses on the use of digital tools that can create feedback loops within their analog counterparts. I want to create feedback where the digital can inform the analog and vice versa.</p>
    <p>Taking this idea further I am also exploring feedback between research and studio practice and between art and science.</p>

    <p>This poses some interesting questions such as:</p>
    <ul class="resume-bullets">
        <li>How can art influence science?</li>
        <li>How can science influence art?</li>
        <li>And how can these systems be fed back into one another possibly creating new modes of inquiry?</li>
      </ul>
    <p>My research lies within how these disparate modes or disciplines can mold and influence one another possibly creating a form of binary recursion.</p>
