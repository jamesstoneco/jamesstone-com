## Responsive Web Design Statistics

Echoing some of the things that Luke W is talking about is this fantastic infographic courtesy of nerdgraph.  

If you are looking for evidence to convince your stakeholders of the importance of mobile and responsive design, this is a great place to start.


## It’s a Write/Read (Mobile) Web

* [39:26](http://vimeo.com/97305189#t=39m26s) He talks about stakeholder buyin on Mobile First Design 
* [47:00](http://vimeo.com/97305189#t=45m54s) Super surprise tip, out of nowhere!

Be sure to check out this amazing keynote at the NDC Conference by Luke Wroblewski ([@lukew](http://www.twitter.com/lukew)), the author of [Mobile First](/blog/mobile-first-by-luke-wroblewski).

He suggests that sites and apps don't work unless people contribute to them which is why writing is more important that reading. He breaks down a bunch of things he has learned about design for this new write first mobile web by failing.

Learn from his mistakes by watching not by doing.



## AtoZ CSS

This is a fantastic set of screencasts that goes way beyond just the basics in CSS. It is produced by Guy Routledge ([@guyroutledge](http://www.twitter.com/guyroutledge)) who is a front-end developer who has recently found his passion for teaching. 

For him, CSS is one of the things that got him hooked into web development. This is a fantastic series and I highly recommend checking it out. 

Here is a short list of the topics he plans to cover. As of today, he is on :enabled:

auto box‑model color display :enabled float general sibling :hover ID justify @keyframes line‑height @media :nth‑child opacity Pseudo Elements quotes :required @supports text unicode‑range vertical‑align widows translateX rotateY z‑index



## ZURB Foundation Navigation templates for Sketch

[![ZURB Foundation Navigation templates](/images/blog/2014/in-form-26/foundation-wires.jpg)](http://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/346-zurb-foundation-navigation.html)

Sketch by Bohemian Coders is a fantastic vector program that is built for the web. I pretty much use this for all of my projects. Why use this over Adobe Illustrator? 

Two key reasons: 1) it is pixel perfect in an effortless way and 2) it renders and has the same types of effects as css. In fact, it will even render out some of the css for you.

If you already have it or you are sold on using it, check out this free template for creating navigation for your ZURB Foundation 5 mocks.



## Design for Realtime

[![ZURB Foundation Navigation templates](/images/blog/2014/in-form-26/side-by-side.jpg)](http://blog.percolatestudio.com/design/design-for-realtime)

If you have been working with real time reactive sites or apps, maybe using Meteor, Angular, Ember or another single page (state) javascript library this is for you. 

Dominic Nguyen ([@domyen](http://www.twitter.com/domyen)) from [Percolate Studio](http://blog.percolatestudio.com) takes you through a bunch of great animated pattern to consider for reactive mobile apps. 

What's really great about this post is he not only describes his reasoning behind such animated states, but gives a side-by-side animation showing the before and after.




**So what do you think?** Do you agree with Luke Wroblewski's keynote? Do you completely disagree? What about Dominic's reactive mobile patterns? Are they adding something to the experience or are they just slick animations? What about the other resources? I would love to hear what you think in the comments below.
