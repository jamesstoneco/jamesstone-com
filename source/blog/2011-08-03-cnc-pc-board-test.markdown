Today with the assistance of Jamie Heilman I was able to mill out some test circuits of thomas' amplifier design using a 3/32" tapered bit out of 2 sided copper clad board from radio shack. I will have to play with the size of the pads and the traces, they still seem a bit small to me and tomorrow I want to place some text on the board as well.
