If you love Sublime Text and you love ZURB Foundation then if you are like me, you are going to really love the Sublime Text Snippets for ZURB Foundation.SPLIT\_SUMMARY\_BEFORE\_THIS

I have been using ZURB Foundation for quite some time and I can tell you one of the major time wasters is going back and forth to the docs to copy and paste the more complex structures. Sure, you can memorize exactly how the topbar and accordion work, but I am pretty lazy. I am only memorizing things that I use a lot, meaning at least 40 - 50 times per day.

Thats why I am glad that I came across the ZURB Foundation snippets. They are a huge time saver, because I know what components I want, I just need quick access to that boilerplate. And, whats great is that they all come up in the Command Pallet. I just hit Command+Shift+P and type zurb, then I have a list of all the components that I can add. Huge time saver and I don't even have to memorize the zf-whatever syntax if I don't want to.

I am not sure if these are official or not because they are not in the package manager yet, but I came across them in the official ZURB GitHub. So, if you know how to install Sublime Text plugins manually, [jump over to the repo and go crazy](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-5-sublime-snippets). For those that want a short demo with step-by-step instructions on how to get started, check out the screencast below.
