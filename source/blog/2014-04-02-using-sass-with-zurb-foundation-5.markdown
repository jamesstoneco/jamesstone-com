Video description from YouTube:

> In this screencast I will show you how to get started with Sass using ZURB Foundation 5. In this video you will learn what the different scss files are and what they are used for. You will learn how to modify your _settings.scss file to radically change the look and feel of ZURB Foundation 5 and I will even cover some of my best practices. I am using the new libsass in this video but you can use compass as well. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.

So what did you think of this video? Do you use app.scss and _settings.scss in your ZURB Foundation Workflow? Do you have any ideas for future screencasts? If so, I would love to hear from you in the comments.
