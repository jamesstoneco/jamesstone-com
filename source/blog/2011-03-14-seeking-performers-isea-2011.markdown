As Mr. Bricolage, Thomas Asmuth and myself have been selected to present our [Touchstone Workshop](http://kidneutrino.blogspot.com/2011/03/project-selected-for-isea2011-istanbul.html) at ISEA 2011 in Instanbul, Turkey. We are currently seeking both performers and activists to parcitipate in the workshop.

SPLIT\_SUMMARY\_BEFORE\_THIS

From Thomas' Blog:



> the focus of the project is to build a platform/instruments and working with communities rather than making an artifact or specific performance. Stone and i want to release the idea to the world as a creativity tool at this phase.

we are seeking to partner with a Turkish or international performance or activist group who we could guide in building the low cost hacktivist sound generators. Mr. Bricolage is working on securing the funding for hardware and logistics of getting ourselves and materials to the conference and soon we will be announcing fund raising campaigns. 

we specifically seek groups interested in using our design of wearable device for mobile and tactical sonification of the performance space. ideally, we would like to work with a local Turkish performers. if you know of some group who might be interested in an extremely low cost or no-cost workshop to build new sound tools for their work, please contact us at:
