title: GSOC Processing GUI Toolkit Proposal
date: 2012/04/05
---

The GUI Toolkit will allow the rapid development of a UI visually and write framework code for interaction. By capitalizing on the amazing work of Andreas Schlegel in the ControlP5 library ([http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5)) the goal is to create a set of tools that allows the rapid and graphical creation, alignment and customization of UI elements. Additionally a new color picker will be written for ControlP5.

SPLIT\_SUMMARY\_BEFORE\_THIS





## Project Description





  

The processing development environment is a valuable asset to both those new to programming, non-programmers and programmers alike. In my experience as a programmer, artist, student and university instructor there is one area that I believe is lacking in processing and that is of rapid development of user interface elements. In the mid 1990's, just after high school I used the Borland Delphi (Turbo Pascal) RAD (Rapid Application Development) environment. Although it did not work well by todays standards but I believe that a mashup of a Delphi style UI designer combined with the flexibility and ease of programming provided by the ControlP5 library could provide the processing community with a novel tool to approach programming projects that require a UI. This would ease the learning curve and lower the cost of entry for many projects.





The project will comprise of the following elements:





1) The UI Designer: a full screen application written in processing that uses controlP5 elements itself to quickly generate a user interface visually and by modifying parameters. This will save in the standard controlP5 xml format allowing it to be used with the following tools or directly from controlP5 for advanced programmers. Writing this component in Processing is necessary to avoid a complete rewrite of ControlP5 to work natively in JFC/Swing. Additionally it will be an advanced example of ControlP5 / UI work contributed to the community.

processing code for above example (required the ControlP5 library):

2) The Framework Generator: This will have a simple GUI using swing that will allow users to select an xml file, choose several options, and then have the framework code generated on the fly. This will allow the easy sharing and reuse of user interface elements within the processing and controlP5 community.

3) Color Picker: a proper color picker for ControlP5. In my opinion this is a necessary addition to the ControlP5 library either within the project itself or within a fork of the project. This will be a color picker that allows RGB, HSV selection and advanced features.
