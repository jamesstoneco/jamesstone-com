We were lucky enough to Mike Winter ([Stupid Fun Club](http://www.stupidfunclub.com/)) bring the DocuBot down to interrogate some of the students during the gallery crawl on 4/14/09 at SJSU.  I worked with Thomas Asmuth to coordinate the visit, create promotional materials, and setup/breakdown.  After the event, Mike sat down and had a conversation with the Art 210 class in the Faculty Conference Room.
