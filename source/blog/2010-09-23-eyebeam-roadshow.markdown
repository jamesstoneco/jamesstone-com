#### Ticket Machine by [Kaho Abe](http://kahoabe.net) )

A ticket for a trip is an object that gives you exclusive access to an unexplored place.  It is a mere piece of paper, but it carries imagination and anticipation of the future, of what new world it can unlock. The Ticket Machine is a Rube Goldberg type collaborative installation which is triggered with a drop of a coin. The machine then unveils different worlds, created by the collaborators, and finally produces a printed ticket. This installation was created during the Eyebeam Roadshow 2010 at 01SJ in San Jose.
