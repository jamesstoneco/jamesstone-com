First off let me start by saying that I am an independent developer and voice on ZURB Foundation and I don’t have any official affiliation with ZURB and I am not compensated in any way to share my experience.
SPLIT\_SUMMARY\_BEFORE\_THIS

FULL DISCLAIMER: I am a huge fan of ZURB, ZURB Foundation and have been for some time, so there might be a little bit of bias there. :)

A lot of people ask me via email and twitter about my experience becoming ZURB Certified and if I found it useful.

I will attempt to answer both of those questions as well as provide a little bit more background for those who are not super familiar with the program.

There are a bunch of advantages that are basically laid out on the Program Webpage but I wanted to talk about how it has worked for me and why I find it valuable.

## The Benefits

I am an independent developer and designer and my business surrounds consulting and integration of ZURB Foundation across a variety of tech-stacks and CMSs. Being able to put on my website and communication materials shows a level of excellence that not everyone is able to show. Usually this is done very quickly, as in the bullets on my services page but it offers a lot of credibility.

First, it is a rigorous certification program. There is an extensive testing process (which I will get into later) that really proves that you know your stuff.

Second, it is an official certification from ZURB not some independent 3rd party. They are the corporate sponsors and original authors of ZURB Foundation and there is no one more qualified on the planet to make this distinction.

Third, people understand certifications. If you tell someone that your are certified in ZURB Foundation, they understand that you met some sort of requirement of knowledge in order to achieve such a certification.

Fourth, for the people that I work with, everyone knows and loves ZURB. To have an association and to be officially recognized by ZURB has a positive impact on how people see my work.

So, if you are like me and you use ZURB Foundation as a primary driver in your business, you really can’t go wrong.

But what if you are not exactly in my situation, how well would that play out. I think it depends on what you want to do.

First off, there is no other official certification for another responsive front-end framework. Often when I am polling through the different job listings, I often see at least on front-end framework listed. Even though it may list another framework, I still believe that becoming ZURB Foundation certified is something that will help differentiate you from your peers.

This is because a lot of what you learn in the process for the certification is transferable. Meaning, the techniques used can be use in other *ahem* frameworks and there are just slightly different nuances and syntax that you need to learn. If I were hiring for one of those other frameworks, I would certainly take notice.

I think regardless of your career path, it will help you to build your credibility in your field, most likely front-end development or web design.

## My Preparation

I didn’t take any official classes from ZURB although I have heard good things. I have been involved with ZURB Foundation since ZURB Foundation 3 and been active on sites such as Stack Overflow, The ZURB Foundation Forum and YouTube helping other people learn the framework and helping to solve problems. I am a huge advocate of the framework and of helping other people to learn as part of your own learning process.

So what I did in preparation of the certification was just do the things I was normally doing. This included writing a book, posting videos on YouTube and creating a ton of sites using ZURB Foundation. I can’t say what I did in particular, but I can tell you that I am always picking through the source code, especially of the sass/scss files because I am interested in how it is put together.

So, if you are looking at materials and classes to help you prepare I think you should really push things as far as you can to give yourself the best chance of passing the exam on the first try.

To be honest, I was pretty nervous about passing the exam, even though I often feel pretty confident about my skill level. This included some last minute cramming, reading of documentation and looking at advanced features of ZURB Foundation the few nights leading up to the exam.

## Exam Day

So 10am rolled around and I was pretty excited about the exam. I didn’t know exactly what was going to happen or how it was going to work. I was like a hitting-refresh-on-gmail-maniac.

Then I got an email and a link to a google doc. I was given 2 hours and it was a mix of multiple choice, essay and code problems to solve. I am not going to say how much of each or what those questions are, but I will tell you, it was challenging to finish the exam in the time given.

It is open book, meaning you can use the web, foundation docs and your favorite editors
1. It is time limited to 2 hours
2. It will really test the extent of your ZURB Foundation knowledge. Be sure to study advanced topics well.
3. You will need to be able to code a variety of sites on the fly and they are very difficult. Especially given the time crunch.

I felt pretty worn out by the end of it and just like many other difficult timed test I took–I’m looking at you GRE—it is quite the marathon affair.

I did all of my usual tricks:

1. I split the time of the questions so I could gauge my time. 2.4 minutes per question. Some were going to take much longer.
2. I answered the easy questions first as fast as possible
3. I double-checked answers
4. I made sure I answered every question

Did it help? Well I passed, so it is hard to say. It is a difficult test and like I said, I am pretty advanced with ZURB Foundation so it was no easy test. I jokingly thought it might be at one point, but I was quickly corrected once I saw some the questions.

## Post Exam

So after the exam they chat with you and if there is any clarification needed they get it from you right on the spot.

The next day I was scheduled with a short call with Rafi. What was nice about this is they went through my answers and solutions and where there was room for improvement they let me know. It was super insightful, much like sitting down with the collective conscious of the Core ZURB Dev Team and getting a small code review.

## Questions

So if you have any questions about the certification process or how that is working for me personally, let me know in the comments.
