In a graduate seminar this semester I am reading a book by Kenneth Goldsmith called [Uncreative Writing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231149913/). He teaches poetry at UPenn a class of the same name where he tells his students that they will not be doing any creative writing of any kind, that everything will be stolen and plagiarized, two big no-no's in academia. In fact his final assignment is to purchase a term paper from a "paper mill" and then defend it.

SPLIT\_SUMMARY\_BEFORE\_THIS

I have so far read the introduction and the 1st chapter. Some of my classmates complain about the mechanics of his writing but to be honest I am more interested in the ideas and I did not notice this in a negative way.

To me this book is very smart. He seems to be taking some postmodern ideas such as that of Delueze's Rhizome, looking to visual art as a reference, and creating a poetic textual mash-up. It reminds me of some of the great enthusiasm and interest in the early internet in terms of hyper-textuality using the Rhizome metaphor and the hope for cyberspace outlined _Ã  la_ Mondo2000. It seems that thoughts and spaces such as the LambdaMOO seem to be reused today as maybe literature is falling way behind.

When I think about this though, I do not think that this is exactly the case. What I think about is all of the open source projects and movements that have be archiving not just classic texts but any texts they can get their virtual hands on.

And so, this book proposes, we should not be creating any new texts. There is enough of that already, but rather we should remix, mashup, and reconfigure such texts into expressions of the the now or contemporary society.

On a side note, I am very interested and influenced by this book because of some [experiments](http://www.jamesjamesjames.com/?p=1070) I did over the summer during my residency at the Institute for the Arts and the Humanities at Penn State. I was interested in how the rhizome or cyborg might manifest in the process of generating a traditional thesis in an non-traditional way. I am seeing a lot of connections between my experiment and what Goldsmith is speaking of. I feel that it is giving me a better context and way of describing these methods I was using. Right now these are just some fleeting thoughts. I hope to further reflect on these ideas and more specifically identify some of the intersections in the near future.

Love this book so far. I highly recommend it. I am also reading it on kindle which is fun, however, it seems that the fact that it is linear and not "hyperlinked" is a missed opportunity.
