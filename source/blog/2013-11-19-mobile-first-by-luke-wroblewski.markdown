I read [Mobile First](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937557022/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937557022&linkCode=as2&tag=manocom-20) about seven months ago and couldn't put it down. I nearly read again it entirely in one setting. I won't lie, at the time with the upcoming release of Zurb Foundation 4 announced at the [Foundation Meetup](/blog/zurb-foundation-4-awesome-2/) and all the Talk about Mobile First I was more than curious. Over the past half year I have heard myself making very  recommendations based on this book to clients who are trying to flush out a prototype or MVP.

		<p>Most of the people that have suggested the mobile first approach have told me that it fundamentally changed their perspective and that they were able to drill down on what their key customer needs were. I recently reread Mobile First over a period of two days in my free time during a trip to Armenia and I still find myself very excited about many of the same ideas. The difference is that now I  understand how some of Luke's philosophy influenced Zurb F4 (and now Bootstrap 3)and consequently how to put some his philosophy out into the wild using this very same framework.</p>

		<h3>The Premise</h3>

		<p>The overarching idea of the book is quite simple. Approach web design problems as if you are forced with the constraints of designing for a mobile touch enabled device such as the iphone, android or windows phone. This has several benefits including: simplification, elimination of unnecessary features, and being more pleasurable to use. These are just to name a few.</p>

	<h4>&rdquo;Mobile First is packed with the best kind of persuasion&mdash;persuasion from data, letting the facts shriek for themselves. And it offers the best kind of advice: practical, immediate, user-focused, big-picture stuff that sweats every detail and respects your IQ and your experience as a practitioner.&ldquo;

One of the promises in the foreword by Jeffrey Zerlman is that Luke backs up all of his recommendations with data. Luke does not disappoint in this regard. My [kindle/.mobi version](http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first) has a shortened url (as well as the full reference in an appendix) showing you exactly the web source of the quote or statistic. In my opinion this is a wonderful thing and brings the accountability of academic papers to the world of startups, web and product design. Bravo. I would love to see this trend continue.
