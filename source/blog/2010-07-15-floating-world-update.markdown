The public art project that I am a partner in is getting closer to the fabrication phase. There is a tentative installation date of August 9 - 11 where I should be onsite, helping with the electrical components of the piece. There is also discussion of projecting the flood video that I worked on with Robin Lasser during the Zero 1 Festival, September 16 - 19.
