I read [Mobile First](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937557022/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937557022&linkCode=as2&tag=manocom-20) and couldn't put it down. I won't lie, at the time with the upcoming release of [Zurb Foundation 4](/blog/zurb-foundation-4-awesome-2/) and everyone talking about Mobile First I was more than curious. I recently read it again and everything still rings true today.

SPLIT\_SUMMARY\_BEFORE\_THIS

### The Premise

The overarching idea of the book is quite simple. <strong>Approach web design problems as if you are forced with the constraints of designing for a mobile touch enabled device such as the iphone, android or windows phone</strong>. This has several benefits including: simplification, elimination of unnecessary features, and being more pleasurable to use. These are just to name a few.

<blockquote class="panel callout" cite="http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first">
	<h4>&rdquo;Mobile First is packed with the best kind of persuasion&mdash;persuasion from data, letting the facts shriek for themselves. And it offers the best kind of advice: practical, immediate, user-focused, big-picture stuff that sweats every detail and respects your IQ and your experience as a practitioner.&ldquo;
</h4>

</blockquote>

One of the promises in the foreword by Jeffrey Zerlman is that Luke backs up all of his recommendations with data. Luke does not disappoint in this regard. My [kindle/.mobi version](http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first) has a shortened url (as well as the full reference in an appendix) showing you exactly the web source of the quote or statistic. <strong>This is a wonderful thing and brings the accountability of academic papers to the world of startups, web and product design</strong>. Bravo. I would love to see this trend continue.

### My Favorite Part

I really enjoyed the part in Chapter 2, Constraints, that talks about screen size. Going from a 1024 x 768 screen down to a 320 x 480 pixel screen gives you only about 1/5 the space.

So what about the rest of that stuff? It either has to find a new home or be removed, and Luke reminds us that this is "terrific."

	<h4>&rdquo;This isn't just an opportunity to create a mobile version of your web product; it's an opportunity to provide an improved customer experience for your customers.&ldquo;
</h4>
</blockquote>

In my experience I believe what we are witnessing is mobile ux principals and design patterns coming back up through the ecosystem. This has resulted in a whole new breed of desktop web apps resembling more and more their mobile counterparts.

I believe that easy to use front end frameworks such as Zurb Foundation are making this transition not only easier and faster to implement, but also more consistent in their application.

I think this book offers a wealth of great examples (even if they might be dated) and gives a lot of fantastic advice as to where to look for opportunities--touch gestures like pull to refresh for example.

Given this book was published in 2011, decades in the fast paced world of the modern web, much of the insight rings true today.

<blockquote class="panel callout" cite="http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first">
	<h4>&rdquo;I'll give you a quick recap: mobile is growing like crazy. (Really technical, I know).&ldquo;
</h4>
</blockquote>

Today the difference is that everything is faster, with higher resolution, has access to geolocation and the compass, plays video with ease and touch interactions are browser enabled. There is much less separating the world of the native app to that of the web app.

The one thing that remains the same though is the screen size. Even with the advent of the retina display you are still talking about 320 pixels of width and 44 pixels still being a good size touch target.

So the real estate issue is the same, the only difference is the clarity of the image.

So on your next design or redesign where you are thinking about going responsive I encourage you to pick up this book and consider trimming the fat. Your users will love you for it, if you can convince your stakeholders to [kill their darlings](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Faulkner).

If you want to pick up a copy check out the [Amazon Product Page](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937557022/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937557022&linkCode=as2&tag=manocom-20).

Have you read this book? Do you agree or disagree with my take on it? Have you read anything else that has influenced your design of web apps or sites?

If so I would love to hear from you in the comments.
