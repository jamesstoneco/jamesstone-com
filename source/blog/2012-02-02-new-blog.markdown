Last night I participated in an amazing webinar led by Andy Drish. I was super impressed by some of the tactics and concepts he suggest that people follow in regards to a job search and building ones network.

SPLIT\_SUMMARY\_BEFORE\_THIS

I an attempt to follow up on some of his suggestions I have made jamesjamesjames.com my personal career blog of sorts where I will post everything interesting I am doing and want to share.

I will also be refining my other website www.manofstone.com to be a more formal portfolio website. Because I have a lot of content on that site, I will be slowly migrating it here, and adding a update link.

Hope you enjoy what is to come.
