### Original Post

Today I recorded a short series of 6 screencasts to take you through the basics of setting up a ZURB Foundation 5 project with compass / sass and how to use the grid, starting with the desktop, making modifications to the mobile grid and finally refining the tablet / medium grid that I touched on in a [previous post](http://www.manofstone.com/blog/zurb-foundation-5-medium-grid).
